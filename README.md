Hi, I'm Nematullah 👋

    🔭 I’m currently working on MOAM’s digital logistics platform (Core, Cargo, Courier, WMS)
    
    🌱 I’m currently learning advanced system architecture, DevOps automation, and AI-assisted development
    
    👯 I’m looking to collaborate on .NET, React, Flutter, and logistics tech projects
    
    🤔 I’m looking for help with scalable cloud infrastructure best practices
    
    💬 Ask me about AI-augmented development, logistics systems, and modular architecture
    
    ⚡ Fun fact: I build large-scale systems as a solo tech unit powered by AI tools
